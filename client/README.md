#MERN-Login-Panel

For #MERN-Login-Panel I have created two folders such as client for Front-End and server for Back-End

client - Front-End(React JS,JavScript,HTML5,CSS3)
server - Back-End(Node JS, Express.js, Mango DB)

And pushed the code to GitHub accordingly

For Displaying the page on web (for roues) , You should navigate like this

For Login page just run the local host 
Eg: http://localhost:3000/

For getting Dashboard, You just run like,

Eg: http://localhost:3000/dashboard

For getting CreateEmployeeTable

Eg: http://localhost:3000/createemployeetable

SO, this is way to navigate between the pages in web.
